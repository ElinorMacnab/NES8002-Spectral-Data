# NES8002-Spectral-Data
Original NMR and selected IR data from an investigation into the synthesis of bioactive fluorochalcones
Each compound is identified according to the order in which they were synthesised (first 1-2 digits; 0 => <strong>1</strong>, 1 => <strong>20</strong>, 2 => <strong>21</strong>, 3 => <strong>22</strong>, 4 => <strong>23</strong>, 5 => <strong>25</strong>, 6 => <strong>24</strong>, 7 => <strong>28</strong>, 8 => <strong>26</strong>, 9=> <strong>27</strong>, 10 => <strong>31</strong>, 11 => <strong>29</strong>, 12 => <strong>30</strong>, 13 => <strong>32</strong>, 14 => <strong>33</strong>) and the attempt number (last digit).
C = crude, P = pure, PC = pure by column, PR = pure by recrystallisation
Any other digits after C refer to isolation methods (please contact the author for more details); any other digits after P refer to groups of fractions after chromatography; any other digits after PC are fraction numbers.
